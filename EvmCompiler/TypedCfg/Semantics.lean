Fuel-indexed multi-block execution.

Fuel exhaustion leaves the current control point as a residual jump. This is
the compositional boundary used by source proofs: a compiled source fragment
may establish that execution reaches its continuation label without executing
the continuation's sentinel block. The input state is already at the semantic
entry to the block; consuming the emitted Assembly label byte belongs to the
TypedCfg-to-Assembly preservation theorem, not this IR interpreter.
