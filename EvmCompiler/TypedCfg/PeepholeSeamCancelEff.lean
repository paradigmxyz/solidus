# Route-α seam canceller: conjugating, clean-seam variant (session-70/71)

PEEPHOLE_PROGRESS §Session-70/71 established, by per-instruction provenance +
`wellTyped?`/`lower?` probes on the ExternalCallBox corpus, the exact shape of the
61 removable `SWAPn;SWAPn` seams and the **corrected** transform:

* Every source block of a firing seam has body **exactly** `[.swap d,
  .bindLocals 0 names]` (`d + 1 < names.length`), terminator `.jump G`, `G` a
  unique-predecessor non-entry block whose head is `.swap d`. The `.bindLocals`
  lowers to `[]` and runs as an EVMState identity, so `A` *emits* only `swap d`,
  which abuts `G`'s head `swap d` after `elideFallthroughJumps` — the removable
  pair (§60, confirmed 61/61).

* **The naive "drop the swap, keep the bind" edit is UNSOUND at the type level.**
  The trailing `bindLocals 0 names` *relabels* the swapped slots; dropping the
  upstream swap makes it mislabel the runtime values (probe: it named position 0
  `param` where `param_1` actually sits). The sound edit must **conjugate the
  bind's names** through the `0 ↔ d+1` transposition:
  `bindLocals 0 names ↦ bindLocals 0 (swapPos 0 (d+1) names)`, re-typing the
  source `output` as `remapShape d output` (exactly as the shipped
  `seamCancelProgram` does). `bindLocals` is a runtime identity for *any* names,
  so the runtime is untouched by the name permutation.

* Because these blocks emit a **single** swap (head = emitted-tail), a swap shared
  by a chain `C → A → B` would be double-claimed. The `2 ≤ length`-distinct-index
  disjointness of the shipped canceller does not hold here, so a seam fires only
  when **both endpoints' swaps are private** (`cleanSrc?` / `cleanTgt?`): the
  source is not itself a seam target and its target is not itself a seam source.
  On ECB this fires on 53/61 seams (8 dropped to overlap), yielding a **well-typed,
  lowerable** program (`wellTyped? = true`, probe) with a real byte delta.

This leaf is the **static half** of the corrected Route-α transform. It is
imported by **nobody** in the spine and hence cannot affect the `compile_correct`
axioms; the runtime pending-swap bisimulation + splice is the remaining frontier.

`input` types to `remapShape d output`, whenever the original body
