# Block-reorder canonicalisation (session-99, "the jump-threading vein")

## Empirical motivation (PEEPHOLE_PROGRESS §Session-99)

After the shuffle-drop vein was closed as exhausted (§98: the banked `realize`
minimiser recovers only 8 B live, the §95 "2 480 B ceiling" was an unphysical
cost model), a fresh probe of the §95 *fallback* candidate — block-merge /
jump-threading — was run PROBE-FIRST through the REAL pipeline
(`chainCanonProgram (seamCancelEff (peephole (normalize cfg))) → lower? →
Assembly.Compact.compile? → bytes`).

The frozen serializer `Assembly.Compact.prepare` already performs the *whole*
block-merge (`elideFallthroughJumps` removes `jump L; label L`, then
`pruneUnreferencedLabels` removes the now-dead `JUMPDEST`) — **but only for
blocks that are physically adjacent in `blocksInLoweringOrder?`**.  And
`blocksInLoweringOrder?` does **no** fallthrough-greedy ordering: it pins the
entry block first and otherwise keeps `program.blocks` list order verbatim
(`Syntax.lean`).  `chainCanonProgram` (§94, LIVE) rewrites bodies of
already-adjacent chains but **never reorders**.

So the entire block-merge vein reduces to one cfg-altitude lever: **reorder
`program.blocks` so that unconditional-`jump` unique-successor edges become
physically adjacent**, letting the frozen `prepare` consume them.  Semantically
this is a *pure permutation* of the block list (blocks are label-addressed via
`findBlock?`/`JUMPDEST`), with every block's `body`/`term`/`input`/`output`
**verbatim** — far cheaper to justify than the `chainCanon`/shuffle-drop body
rewrites.

## Measured reachability (§Session-99, the SOUND transform, not a deduced ceiling)

Greedy fallthrough layout (`layoutBlocks` below), measured on 15 corpus contracts
(60 % of corpus runtime bytes) through the real pipeline:

* **891 B measured** total delta (2.05 % of the 43 496 B measured base);
  extrapolates to ≈1 100–1 300 B / ≈ −1.5 %…−1.8 % corpus-wide.
* Every measured reorder was a genuine permutation (`isPerm = true`) with
  **zero** `.fallthrough` terminators (`ftTerms = 0`) ⟹ the reordered bytecode is
  semantically equivalent (only PCs move; jumps re-resolve).
* The §95 block-merge "≈2 300 B ceiling" (927 `PUSHn;JUMP;JUMPDEST` triples) is
  itself a ≈4× mirage under the §98 discipline: the sound-reachable delta on the
  worst-7 is 547 B, not 2 300 B — a block can fall through to only ONE successor,
  and most surviving triples target multi-predecessor (`refCount ≥ 2`) blocks.

This is ≈110× the shuffle-drop live delta (8 B), sound, and proof-cheaper than
`chainCanon`.  This module banks the **total transform + structural floor**
(the §57/§95 "transform + structural kernels FIRST" pattern).  The deep
preservation tower (block-multiset `Perm`, `findBlock?` permutation-congruence of
the cfg operational semantics, `WellTyped`/PCI/fuel invariance, the OIC
`_of_source` forward-refinement + the 8-site `CertifiedChoice` rewire) is the
successor's frontier — see §Session-99.

This module is imported by nobody ⟹ it cannot touch the `compile_correct` cone.

/-! ## The equality core (session-100)

The reorder is a *pure permutation* of the block list, so the label-addressed
`findBlock?` is extensionally unchanged.  Because the cfg operational semantics
(`InteractionSemantics.openStep`/`openRunN`) read `source` **only** through
`source.findBlock?`, this extensional equality is the whole semantic content of
the reorder at the cfg altitude.  The chain is:

* `growLayout_spec` — every chain emits `Nodup`, `placed`-disjoint labels and the
  outgoing `placed` set is exactly the incoming set plus the emitted labels;
* `foldLabels_spec` / `foldl_seed_mem` — the layout fold is `Nodup` and covers
  every original block label;
* `layoutBlocks_coverage` + the banked `layoutBlocks_mem` — block membership is
  preserved *both ways* (a genuine permutation);
* `reorderProgram_blocks_perm`, `reorderProgram_labelsUnique`, and
  `findBlock?_reorderProgram` — the observable conclusions.
